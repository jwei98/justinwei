		<h2> <center>About Me</center> </h2>
		<p>Hello! My name is Justin Wei, and I'm a <strong>passionate learner</strong> and <strong>problem-solver</strong>.
			I currently attend <span style="color: blue"><strong>Duke University</strong></span>, studying <strong>Computer Science and Neuroscience</strong>.
			In my free time I enjoy being outdoors, spending time with friends, and in general <strong>challenging myself</strong>
			both mentally and physically. I'm extremely interested in <strong>advancing the unexplored frontiers</strong> of software engineering
			and neuroscience, and perhaps the intersection of the two. You can find out more about what I'm involved in
			around campus below!

		<h2> Activities </h2>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Researcher at Nicolelis Lab</b>- The <a href="http://www.nicolelislab.net/" target="_blank">Nicolelis Lab</a> pioneers research regarding neuronal population coding,
			Brain Machine Interfaces, and neuroprosthetics. I think the research being done at this lab is fascinating as it lies at the intersection of both neuroscience and computer
			science, and has both academic and practical implications. I joined the lab in January 2017 and am studying _______________________.</li>
			<li><b>Delta Sigma Pi (DSP)</b>- <a href="https://www.deltasigmapi.org/" target="_blank">DSP</a> is a professional business fraternity that brings together those interested
			in business, technology, and finance. I recently rushed and pledged the fraternity in the Fall of 2016, and as part of the pledge process, we were required to attend weekly meetings and classes to develop our professional selves.
			I've been impressed with and loved everyone I've met through DSP, and I've received incredible mentorship from upperclassmen in the fraternity.
			Because of the amount I've enjoyed being a part of the fraternity, I will serve as my chapter's Marketing Director during the Spring '17 rush period.
			</li>
			<li><b>Project Waves Staff</b>- <a href="https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/new-students/preorientation-programs/project-waves">Project Waves (PWaves)</a> is a pre-orientation
				program for freshmen at Duke. About 80 freshmen have the opportunity to come to Duke a week before orientation to bond with their classmates at the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
			 	The program is completely student-run, so as member of staff, I help plan this week for the incoming freshmen class in order to make them feel comfortable, bond with each other, and 
				faciliate their trasntion to college.</li>
